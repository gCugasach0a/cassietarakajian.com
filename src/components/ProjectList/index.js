          p5.js is an creative coding library for making interactive and
          generative visuals and sounds. As part of their ongoing effort
          to bring programming to a wider and more diverse audience, the
          Processing Foundation and NYU ITP wanted to create a p5.js editor
          for the web. Goals for the project include making a beginner
          friendly environment, creating a tool for teaching, and making
          web accessibility a priority. It is an open source project.
